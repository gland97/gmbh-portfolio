            <p class="article-separator">Huxley Demur was eight years old, standing in a Redwood Restaurant searching for the Son 
              of Hercules theme song on the jukebox when he realized god wasn't real.
            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">His mind accelerated into itself, seizing only briefly when it folded over and weaved 
              back again with even greater intensity only to lurch sideways, severing it entirely from threads of prior consciousness.
            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">It would be almost eleven years later in the blackness of rural Australia that Huxley would 
              revisit those threads of pure existence. He had quite abruptly traversed them as an eight-year-old, all while safely 
              under the guise of searching for a song on the jukebox. But those same stale and severed threads had since been retreating 
              into quiet seclusion, surely never to fuse themselves with a mind of indifference.
            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">In Australia, Huxley had found an unknowable land. The lush coast reminded him of the dense 
              Monteverde Rainforest in Costa Rica, but once the thick vegetation found the sea it opened up to beaches that resembled 
              the central Californian coast. And further, the coastal vegetation sometimes opened-up to reveal a flowing mass of grassland wildly 
              resembling that of western Montana. The more he saw, the more perplexed Huxley became. The sparse vegetation in the interior was 
              like that of the African savannah, a sophisticated trunk gave way to wide, flattened crowns spanning laterally almost twice the tree's 
              height. In the Northern Territory, he found a surprising similarity to southern Mexico. He remembered being absolutely sure the coastal 
              town of Nhulunbuy could be plucked from Australia and plopped anywhere along the coast between Achupulco and Petatl√°n without the 
              slightest natural mismatch. And even the unforgiving Red Center, where Huxley was sure he would be able to draw no comparison, reminded 
              him of southern Algeria, where one escaped the sweltering day only when darkness crawled westward, blanketing a world of silence in its wake.
            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">He understood the evolutionary science that yielded these similarities across the world, but that was 
              entirely irrelevant. The Unknowable Australia was much less about Australia as it was about Huxley. The uncanny sameness of place 
              he encountered all across the country prompted visceral confrontations with the passage of time.
            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">Time began to bend. It doubled over on itself and peered far past the present in any single occurrence. 
              In these moments of sameness, time moved as a force acting on Huxley as it did in everyday life, but rather than a subliminal 
              expectation, time transformed into a narrow mental passage, one that must be pursued with intention (even if he wasn't sure what for) 
              until time expanded back again, allowing the mind to withdraw him, unwillingly, to the immediacy of the present.
            </p>      
            <p class="article-separator">The present for Huxley was somewhere between Sydney and Melbourne. He'd woken up on a bus two odd hours 
              outside of Melbourne when a road-sign with "Nungurner, Pop. 230" had flashed by before the last stop.
            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">He'd camped outside the night he arrived in Nungurner, straddling a hill with patchwork fields so expansive 
              he felt they enveloped him out of existence. And if the earth hadn't, then all that was above it had. He had been all over Australia, 
              the world even, but the sky this particular night left him paralyzed with awe, unable to adequately transfer the vastness of a universe 
              through his cornea and into mere light pulses.
            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">Huxley's mind knew the blackness he confronted was more tangible, more visible in that moment than his own 
              hand might have been if set inches from his face. But in reality, the blackness was just space that lacked a visible tethering point.
            </p>          
            <p class="article-separator">But the blackness wasn't alone. The most magnificent swirls and bulges of glowing matter suspended trillions 
              of miles from his vantage point unraveled, exposing themselves before his eyes. Glowing pin-pricks of light reduced themselves to the 
              sharpest observable points in the distance giving way to a flurry of motion that resembled something of a flame twitching in a sudden breeze. 
              A cosmic anti-glitch. Just as time had bent on occasion for Huxley, so too did the universe. He wondered if this was the same thing, or not at all.
            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">Suddenly the sharpness of trillions compressed laterally then swelled outward on the same plane, like a drop of dye 
              into water. The tremendous mass then folded upward and back onto itself, revealing the underbelly of the universe. Huxley thought his unbelieving 
              eyes must've blinked, for the fold had concentrated the matter into a single visible point before his mind was able to process any motion at all. 
              The blackness which had held up a universe, now exposed itself to Huxley through a single point of white light.
            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">Despite the raging universe, the trifles of Earth remained. Whooshing and rushing of tall grass swayed in masses in 
              what felt like the Earth's acknowledgement of far-away happenings. And although Huxley felt his mind reaching far past his physical body, he 
              knew the Earth was protecting him from the transforming universe.

            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">Still captivated by the stand-alone star, Huxley's mind accelerated into the light. Time began to bend, but this 
              time Huxley wasn't sure what had triggered it. It wasn't place, the usual offender. He knew how time worked by now, though, and the less he 
              succumbed himself to its rage, the faster reality would draw him from its intended path. So, he released his mind from his body and allowed 
              the narrowness of time to steer his conscious into the place it desired.
            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">An in the blackness between the soil of the Earth and white light of a universe, Huxley found himself staring through 
              scratched plexiglass, into the eyes of a boy.

            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">His glossed eyes focused far past the scratched, jukebox plexiglass that encapsulated a world of its own. His eyes 
              longed to match the depths of his mind, desperately trying to arrive at a singular, comprehensible point; one of a dimension that surely had to 
              be accounted for in the physical world. But just as his mind had plunged into the depths and broken past the threshold of comprehension only to 
              return to pragmatism just seconds later, Huxley's vision followed. Swellings of color shrunk towards their most concentrated points and the white 
              he had disappeared into returned to the rectangle it was. His mind ignored the suddenly cognizant want for prolongation, withdrawing him, unwillingly, 
              to the immediacy of the present, the jukebox.

            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">He noticed now the white rectangle as it was, positioned nicely within the blackness of the rest of the vinyl album cover. 
              The white rectangle bore the face of an ageless woman who reminded him of someone and no one in particular. Forgetting momentarily about his beloved 
              Son of Hercules theme song, he chose the album and walked away from the jukebox to the steady strum of Jeff Beck's "Hi Ho Silver Lining:"
            </p>
            <p class="article-separator">"You're everywhere and nowhere baby
              <br>that's where you're at..."
            </p>
